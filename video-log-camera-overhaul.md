## Goal

Make the video log feel seamless on Android, macOS and Windows: smooth ready, countdown and recording states with a button that reflects each, no visible lag before recording starts, a preview that matches the native camera's field of view and quality, macOS Control Center effects that stay on, a preview that fills the window without hiding what is recorded, and controls that fade away while recording.

## Done when

- [ ] c1 Ready, countdown and recording transition smoothly and the record button visibly differs in each state
- [ ] c2 The pause between countdown and recording is explained and removed or hidden
- [ ] c3 The Field Notes preview shows the same field of view as the native camera at 1x and is not visibly worse in quality
- [ ] c4 macOS Control Center effects that are on before the recorder opens stay on after it opens
- [ ] c5 The preview fills the window with nothing recorded hidden from the user
- [ ] c6 Non-essential controls fade out smoothly during recording and return when needed

## Where things stand

The owner approved the intent and told the run to work unattended. The spec, record and Steps are written and passed every scripted check; its one independent review returned nine issues, which are being fixed once. The glossary terms and two decision records are written. Nothing is built.

## Next step

The drive entered plan and runs it next.

## Decisions in force

- D1 hand-off: build the video log and camera overhaul as two stacked pull requests: Build the spec as two stacked pull requests, camera-engine then recorder-screen, unattended, opening them for the owner to merge.

## Open risks

## Settled, do not reopen
